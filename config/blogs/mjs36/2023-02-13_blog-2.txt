Assigned actions

Hours: 3

Action 2: Algorithm for Checkmate

A brute force approach was thought of. This would find the valid moves for the king, and every move of the opponents pieces. If an opponents could move to the kings location, but the king could move, that would be check. If it could move, that would be check mate. Friendly players would also be checked to see if they can sacrifice and block the king from danger.
Another similar approach would be to check if any piece has line of sight of the king, checking up, down, left, and right; remembering the knight can jump.
