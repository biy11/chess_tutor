Supplementary Assigned actions (decided in private group meeting)
==============

Action 1: Assign coding sub teams

Hours: 0

Action 2: Backend coding

Started on main project code. I programmed all the piece classes, except Pawn and castling for the King. After Bilal had problems with his version of the Pawn class, I made my own but intend to delete this. I then programmed very basic Board, Square, and Player classes. I also added Game class, a Main class, and two enum classes. As there were struggles with the Pawn class, I developed the Pawn class and the enPassant move checker. I also made a static method to move pieces.

Hours: 7
