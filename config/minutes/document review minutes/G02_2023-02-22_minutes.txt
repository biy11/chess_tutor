New business 
============
3. Grammatical errors
- There were various grammatical and sentence structure problems with 
the document. We were not able to cover them all but decided it was
enough to warrant a look over
- Under beginner, the last sentence needs to be changed to 'to indicate'
- Everything needs to be changed to American spelling 'color'
ACTION: TPR3, JAB153, LVS1, WIA14

4. Problems with use cases
- UC03 does not have enough detail
- UC05 needs to be changed to 'capture piece' and correct 'USB05'
- UC06 promotion is mandatory and the use case has to reflect this
- UC13 castling can only prompted when the King is selected and not the rook
- UC13 should now mention a yellow prompt instead of lowered opacity
- New use case needed for accepting a draw offer
ACTION: TPR3, JAB153, LVS1, WIA14

5. Use cases need to be restructured so that they are seperated into
sections
- The use cases were in a semi-random order which made things confusing for
the presentation. They will need to be organised into a more cohesive format.
ACTION: TPR3, JAB153, LVS1, WIA14

6. Refrencing Wikipedia is not allowed
- Changing to the refrences needs to be completed
ACTION: TPR3, JAB153, LVS1, WIA14

7. Problems with error conditions
- There needs to be a new error condition covering resizing the chess game
window
- EC04 needs more detail and changed to 'capture piece'
- There needs to be an error condition for promotion
ACTION: TPR3, JAB153, LVS1, WIA14

8. Issues with the presentation
- Removed pieces bars need to be changed and made smaller
- UC13 should use yellow instead of lowered opacity
- There need to be clearer prompts for who's turn it is (maybe in the corner)
- If the opposing player offers a draw it should be clear it is the other player
who is deciding to accept
- Chess board pattern was incorrect
- Sub heading for error conditions is irrelevant
